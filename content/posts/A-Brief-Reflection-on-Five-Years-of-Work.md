I've been working in my current team for almost five years. Looking back, there are probably fewer than five things I've truly done well. Over these five years, I feel that I haven't used my time well. This isn't a team issue or a cultural issue - it's that I never really sought my own vision. And even when I occasionally caught a glimpse of it, I didn't pursue it. This is something worth reflecting on.
