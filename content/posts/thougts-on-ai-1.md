For me, vibe coding boots efficiency and saves a lot fo time. While waiting for AI to finish, it feels natural to start another task with a different AI - then a second, a third, even a fourth. But I'm really not suited to multitasking. Constant context switching gives me a headache. Are others the same? I feel that extreme multitasking, which heavily drains mental energy, isn't a normal state. People genuienly need rest, quiet, and time for mental blank space.
