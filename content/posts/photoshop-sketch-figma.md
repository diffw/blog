I belong to the earliest generation that used Photoshop for UX/UI design. I was genuinely surprised that Sketch later out-innovated Photoshop so completely in the UX field. Then Figma came along, and Sketch suddenly felt outdated.

I deeply admired how innovative Figma was and how well it understood designers' real needs. I absolutely love Figma. When it went public, I stayed calm and diden't buy the stock.

Then the AI era arrived, and Figma launched Figma Make. After using it for a while, I finally bought some shares when the stock price returned to its IPO level. I hope it might grow tenfold, but right now that seems uncertian-because in this age of AI-driven innovation, Figma is starting to feel like the next Sketch of the past.
