The valuations of today’s tech companies are extremely high, somewhat reminiscent of the internet bubble of the 1990s. This is why some say we are experiencing a new AI bubble. But this time is different. During the dot-com era, having a website alone could attract investment and receive a high valuation—even if it had little real value. AI, however, is not the same. Whether in daily life or in professional fields like design and coding, AI offers practical, tangible benefits that people can truly experience. Because of this, there are still clear differences between the two eras.<br>

现在科技公司的估值都非常高，有点像上世纪 90 年代的互联网泡沫。因此有人说，这是一场新的 AI 泡沫。但这次与过去还是有些不同。当年互联网泡沫时期，只要有一个网站似乎就能拿到投资、获得很高估值，哪怕几乎没有实际使用价值。而这一次的 AI 不太一样。AI 无论在日常生活，还是在设计、写代码等专业领域，都有非常实际的应用，让人切实感受到它带来的便捷与高效。因此，两者之间仍然存在明显的差别。
