The valuations of today’s tech companies are extremely high, somewhat reminiscent of the internet bubble of the 1990s. This is why some say we are experiencing a new AI bubble. But this time is different. During the dot-com era, having a website alone could attract investment and receive a high valuation—even if it had little real value. AI, however, is not the same. Whether in daily life or in professional fields like design and coding, AI offers practical, tangible benefits that people can truly experience. Because of this, there are still clear differences between the two eras.
