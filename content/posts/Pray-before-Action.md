This morning, I prayed for the design work I need to do. Although I wasn't very willing at first, I still prayed in the end. Some people say that prayer helps us sort out our priorities, and that's absolutely true. When I pray, it means I'm willing to to submit to God's will and his arrangements; when I refuse to pray, it means that I want to be the master and take control myself. The hard truth is that praying always brings better results than not praying.
