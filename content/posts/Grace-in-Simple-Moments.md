This morning I read Ecclesiastes 2:24, which says that there is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in their labor - this too is from the hand of God. My dog had a bit of food poisoning last night, and when I took her out for a walk this morning, the sunlight was beautiful. On a winter morning in Dallas, it felt surprisingly warm. 

I Suddenly felt how blessed I am: a wonderful family, a good job, and the flexibility of working remotely. Yet I'm ashamed that I haven't managed my time well. Instead, my disordered schedule has caused things to pile up, leading to delay and loss of order. And what is the source of true order? I think it is that I have not placed God first.
