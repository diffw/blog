AI has increased our work efficiency. Tasks that used to take four or five days can now be finished in just an hour. This is a good thing, but on the other hand, it makes our hearts more impatient. Since things can be done so fast, we start wanting them to be even faster—faster and faster. This impatience affects our work, then our daily life, and eventually even the state of our spiritual life.

AI 提升了我们的工作效率。原本四五天的工作，现在一个小时就能完成。这是一件好事情，但反过来，却让人的心变得更急躁。既然可以这么快，就会想要更快、更快地完成这些事情。这种急躁会影响工作，接着影响生活，最后影响整个人的信仰状态。
