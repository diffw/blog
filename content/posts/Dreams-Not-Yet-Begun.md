I'm 43 years old and have wroked for 20 years. I once took a risk and joined a startup, and it brought me some success. But I have nerver paused for a period of time to do the things I trully want to do - to read, to create, to design. I've never done that. In the past, perhaps circumstances didn't allow it, but now there is no real pressure for survival. I hope that at some point, I can set everything aside and pursue what I truly want to do, even if it's only for half a year or a full year.
