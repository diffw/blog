A believer, a maker, working at the edges of form and meaning.

I entered the digital world when it was still raw and unpolished, drawn not only to technology but to form, motion, and the space between ideas. Alongside code and interfaces, I have always been learning to see—through drawing, composition, and the slow discipline of making things by hand.

My work has often unfolded quietly, shaped in small rooms and long nights, following a path from fragile beginnings to unlikely scale. I’ve been part of journeys where ideas learned how to survive, mature, and speak to the world.

Moving between places and cultures has sharpened my attention to light, texture, and rhythm—whether on a screen, a page, or a blank surface. These days, I work from a calmer corner of the world, continuing to explore the intersection of faith, design, and art.
