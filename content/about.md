A Christian, a designer, the husband of one woman, and the father of three children.

 I first encountered the internet in college in 2001 and became deeply immersed in web design and Flash animation, witnessing the most open era of the Chinese internet. In 2009, I shifted to app design and became one of the earliest mobile internet designers in China.

From 2013 to 2019, as the 7th employee and the first designer, I participated fully in Liulishuo's journey—from its early startup days in a residential apartment to its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: LAIX).

Born in Changsha, Hunan, I lived in Hangzhou for seven years and Shanghai for nine years. After immigrating to the United States, I spent two years in Los Angeles and now reside in Dallas, Texas.
